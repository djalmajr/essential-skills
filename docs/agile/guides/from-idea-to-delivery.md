# From Idea to Delivery

End-to-end scenarios showing how skills chain together to take a problem from first contact to formal closure. Each scenario uses a different domain and team size to show flexibility.

**Skills covered:** intake, router, task, epic, refinement, status, tdd

---

## Scenario A -- Urgent bug fix (solo dev)

A security report arrives: "Password reset tokens never expire -- users can reuse old links indefinitely."

### Step 1: Capture the problem

```
/intake password reset tokens not expiring
```

The skill asks clarifying questions. You provide:
- **Problem:** Tokens never expire. Security risk -- any old link still works.
- **Who's affected:** All users with password reset capability.
- **Urgency:** High -- security vulnerability.
- **Constraints:** Must not break existing valid tokens in the next 24h.

The intake structures: context (security bug), objective (tokens expire after 1h), value signal (close vulnerability).

**Recommendation:** "This is small, clear, and localized -> `/agile-story` directly."

### Step 2: Route to the right artifact

Since intake already recommended `/agile-story`, you skip the router. But if unsure:

```
/router password reset token expiry
```

The router evaluates: "1 area, few files, simple validation. This is a small, localized change -> `/agile-story`."

### Step 3: Create the execution plan

```
/task password reset tokens not expiring
```

The skill explores the codebase and produces:

- **Context:** AS-IS: tokens valid forever. TO-BE: tokens expire after 1 hour.
- **Files:** `src/auth/tokens.ts` (alter), `src/auth/password-reset.ts` (alter), `src/__tests__/auth/tokens.test.ts` (alter)
- **Tasks:**
  - `[ ]` Add `EXPIRY_MS` constant to `tokens.ts`
  - `[ ]` Update `createResetToken` to include expiry timestamp
  - `[ ]` Add `isTokenExpired` check in `verifyResetToken`
  - `[ ]` Write tests for expired tokens
  - `[ ]` Run lint, typecheck, tests
- **Verification:** `bun run lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, manual test in staging

You confirm. Implementation begins.

### Step 4: Review before committing

```
/refinement
```

The skill reads the diff and applies the code review checklist:
- **Security:** inputs validated, no injection, no hardcoded secrets -- all pass
- **Coherence:** follows existing token pattern -- pass
- **Over-engineering:** no unnecessary abstractions -- pass
- **Scope:** only token expiry, no unrelated changes -- pass
- **Quality:** tests cover expired and valid scenarios -- pass

Result: all clear, no red flags.

### Step 5: Close the delivery

```
/status close password-reset-expiry
```

The skill compares plan vs reality:
- **Delivered:** all 5 tasks completed
- **Pending:** none
- **Verification:** lint pass, typecheck pass, tests pass (12 tests, 2 new)
- **Risks:** monitor password reset flow in prod for 48h
- **Next step:** none -- delivery closed

**Total time: ~45 minutes from report to closure.**

## Scenario B -- Medium feature (dev in a team)

Product requests: "When an order status changes, send an email notification to the customer."

### Step 1: Intake

```
/intake order status email notifications
```

Clarifying questions reveal:
- Statuses that trigger emails: `confirmed`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`
- Email templates: one per status, using existing template engine
- Constraint: must not slow down order processing (async)
- Out of scope: SMS, push notifications, notification preferences

**Recommendation:** "This is a vertical delivery with several files and moderate validation -> `/agile-epic` to structure it."

### Step 2: Structure with epic

```
/epic order status notifications
```

The skill maps the initiative as a single-story epic (or creates the story file directly):
- **In scope:** Event listener for status changes, email sender, 4 templates, tests
- **Out of scope:** SMS, push, preferences UI
- **Files:** `src/orders/events.ts` (alter), `src/notifications/email-sender.ts` (create), `src/notifications/templates/` (create 4), `src/__tests__/notifications/` (create)
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - AC1: Status change to `confirmed` triggers confirmation email within 5s
  - AC2: Status change to `shipped` includes tracking number in email
  - AC3: Status change to `cancelled` triggers cancellation email with refund info
  - AC4: Email sending is async -- order API response time unchanged
  - AC5: Failed email send is retried 3x, then logged as error (no user-facing failure)
- **Tasks:** 8 tasks in vertical slices (event listener -> sender -> templates -> tests)
- **Verification:** `bun test`, manual email check in staging with Mailtrap

You confirm. Implementation begins.

### Step 3: Status tracking (3 days)

**Day 1:**
```
/status
```
- Completed: event listener, email sender skeleton
- Blockers: none
- Next step: implement confirmation and shipped templates

**Day 2:**
```
/status
```
- Completed: 4 email templates, unit tests for sender
- Blocker: Mailtrap credentials not in staging env -- owner: devops, action: Slack message sent
- Next step: integration tests once staging is configured

**Day 3:**
```
/status
```
- Completed: integration tests, all AC verified in staging
- Blockers: resolved (devops added Mailtrap creds)
- Next step: code review and close

### Step 4: Review and close

```
/refinement
```

Flags one issue: duplicated email validation logic in sender and templates. Fix: extract to shared utility. Re-review passes.

```
/status close order-notifications
```

- **Delivered:** all 8 tasks, all 5 AC met
- **Scope change:** none
- **Verification:** lint, typecheck, tests all pass. Manual: 4 emails received in staging.
- **Next step:** monitor email delivery rate in prod for 1 week

## Scenario C -- Quick fix without intake

A designer reports: "The submit button on the settings page says 'Salvar' but should say 'Save Changes'."

This is trivial -- no intake needed.

```
/task fix submit button label on settings page
```

The skill produces a 3-task plan:
1. `[ ]` Change label in `src/pages/settings/SettingsForm.tsx`
2. `[ ]` Update snapshot test
3. `[ ]` Run `bun test`

Implement, verify, commit. No status tracking, no closure -- proportional to the size.

---

## Scenario D -- New feature with TDD

A PM asks: "We need a `DiscountService` that calculates discounts based on customer tier and promo codes."

### Step 1: Plan with `/agile-story`

```
/task discount service with tier + promo codes
```

The skill produces a task file with context, files, acceptance criteria, and an initial checklist (design the API, implement, test, document).

### Step 2: Implement with `/agile-tdd`

Instead of jumping into code, use TDD to drive the implementation:

```
/agile-tdd discount service
```

The skill drives the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

**Red (failing test):**
```ts
// src/services/discount.test.ts
test("calculates 10% discount for silver tier", () => {
  const result = calculateDiscount({ tier: "silver", subtotal: 100 });
  expect(result).toBe(10);
});
```

Run `bun test` -> fails (function does not exist).

**Green (minimum code):**
```ts
// src/services/discount.ts
export function calculateDiscount({ tier, subtotal }) {
  if (tier === "silver") return subtotal * 0.1;
  return 0;
}
```

Run `bun test` -> passes.

**Refactor:**
Extract tier rates to a constant. Tests still pass.

**Next cycle (Red):**
Add a test for promo codes. Fails. Write minimum code. Refactor. Repeat.

### Step 3: Integration test

Once unit tests cover the core logic, add an integration test that hits the DB:

```ts
// tests/integration/discount.test.ts
test("applies discount from DB-stored promo code", async () => {
  await db.insert(promoCodes).values({ code: "SUMMER10", discount: 10 });
  const result = await applyPromoCode("SUMMER10", 100);
  expect(result).toBe(90);
});
```

### Step 4: Verify and close

```
bun test --coverage
```

Check coverage against targets (80%+ for services). Run `/agile-refinement` to review test quality, then `/agile-status` (closure) to wrap up.

**Outcome:**
- 12 unit tests, 3 integration tests, all passing
- 87% coverage on `discount.ts` (above target)
- Implementation driven by tests from day 1 -- no dead code, no untested paths

---

## Scenario E -- Uncertain scope (router)

Someone asks: "What's the status on the auth refactor?"

You're not sure whether to do a checkpoint, a consolidation, or close it out.

```
/router
```

The router asks: "What type of tracking? Quick checkpoint, period consolidation, or closure?"

You explain: "We're 1 week into a 2-week effort and the PM asked where we are."

**Recommendation:** `/agile-status` (consolidation mode) -- this is a mid-flight consolidation, not a daily checkpoint.

```
/status report auth-refactor
```

The report consolidates: 3 of 7 stories completed, 1 blocker (SSO provider API), 2 pending decisions (migration strategy, backward compat). Next steps with owners and dates.

## Key takeaways

1. **Proportional artifacts:** Small changes -> task, medium/large deliveries -> epic, trivial -> task without intake
2. **Intake is optional:** Skip it when the problem is already clear
3. **Refinement before committing:** Catches scope creep, security issues, over-engineering
4. **Status tracks real state:** Blockers have owners and actions, not just "blocked on X"
5. **Status closure closes the loop:** Compares plan vs reality honestly
6. **Router when unsure:** Guides you to the right skill and mode
